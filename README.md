### Hi, I'm Lingteng Qiu ðŸ‘‹
I graduated in October 2024 and joined Alibaba's Tongyi Lab. Prior to that, I had been a Ph.D. student at the School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, under the supervision of Prof. Xiaoguang Han. Before my time at CUHK-Shenzhen, I earned my M.S. from the Department of Automation at Harbin Institute of Technology and my B.S. from Fuzhou University. I am fortunate to have worked closely with Prof. Guanying Chen at SYSU-Sz.
